# Convert A Video File to a Gif in Go


## Note that this code requires you to have the imaginary server running on your local machine, as it uses cURL to send a POST request to the server with the input file and conversion options. The converted file is then saved to disk using the saveFile function.

## You can install and run the imaginary server using the instructions in their documentation: https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#installation.
